        "### Your task is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.\n",

The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this project. Based on individual trip attributes, you should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.\n",
